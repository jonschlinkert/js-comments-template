# js-comments-template [![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/js-comments-template.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-comments-template)

> Default template used by js-comments and helper-apidocs for generating API docs.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm i js-comments-template --save
```

## Templates

The [comment template](./templates/comment.js) creates a comment section in a markdown document, with any or all of the following sub-sections (sub-sections only render if defined in the comment):

* `heading`: section title/heading, linked to the actual code on GitHub associated with the comment. Heading can be set explicity with a `@name` tag.
* `params`: A list of parameters and descriptions, defined with the `@param` tag.
* `examples`: gfm formatted code blocks, defined in a block comment using gfm syntax.
* `returns`: a return statement, defined with the `@return` tag
* `events`: any events emitted, defined with the `@emits` tag

## Example

**Rendered markdown**

<code>

### [.isRegistered](index.js#L105)

Returns true if a plugin has already been registered on an instance. This is optionally used by plugin implementors to prevent plugins from being called on an instanced more than once.

**Events**

* `emits`: `plugin` with `registered` and the name of the plugin as arguments.

**Params**

* `name` **{String}**: The plugin name.
* `returns` **{Boolean}**: Returns true when a plugin is already registered.

**Example**

```js
var base = new Base();
base.use(function(app) {
  if (app.isRegistered('myPlugin')) {
    return;
  }
  // do stuff
});
```

</code>
